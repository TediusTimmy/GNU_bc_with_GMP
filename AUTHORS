Phil Nelson <philnelson@acm.org> wrote bc, including the number.c
source in the "lib" directory.

Ken Pizzini <ken@gnu.org> wrote dc, making use of the lib/number.c
code that Phil Nelson wrote to handle the actual multiprecision
arithmetic.

Thomas DiModica <ricinwich@yahoo.com> rewrote much of number.c and
portions of bc and dc so as to use GMP.
